## Project Summary

Over two thousand bigamy cases have been prosecuted since 1812 in Australia. Data on these prosecutions is readily and uniquely available. Trove, the National Library of Australia's growing repository of full-text digital resources, allows researchers to explore historical newspapers. Over 100,000 hits for "bigamy" in Trove reveal that Australians had a vigorous appetite for bigamy stories. These stories constitute a rich corpus to gauge social expectations surrounding marriage. Furthermore, the Prosecution Project has compiled court cases for all of Australia. Their longitudinal data provide material to analyze the prosecution of bigamy and to locate the corresponding case files in various state archives. The documents included in case files give Dr. Méthot privileged access to those history otherwise leaves behind---in this context, the "everyday" people who were defendants and offenders, as well as their families.


As a systematic analysis of this exhaustive corpus, the proposed project will deepen our understanding of the different roles marriage has played in Australian society from 1812 to the mid-twentieth century. Dr. Méthot's research will shed light on gender, class, and religious expectations, and delve into cultural, social, and economic realities surrounding the institution of marriage. The legal and cultural history of bigamy in Australia, she contends, will have implications for contemporary debates about the nature, roles, and meanings of marriage in Western societies, and thus will interest wide and diverse audiences, including academic communities (legal, family, gender, social and cultural scholars), politicians and lawmakers, and the general public. Furthermore, the project will provide unique opportunities for students to learn transferable research skills in conducting archival research and blending qualitative and quantitative methods.
